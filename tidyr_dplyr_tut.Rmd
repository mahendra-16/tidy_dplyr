## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
Acc_Electricity <- read.csv("D:/GitHub-2/Dataset/Access to Electricity/Access to Electricity.csv")

```


```{r changing colnames of column}
names(Acc_Electricity)[5:32]
names(Acc_Electricity)[5:32] <- c("1990", "1991", "1992", "1993", "1994", "1995",
                                "1996","1997", "1998", "1999", "2000", "2001", 
                                "2002", "2003","2004", "2005", "2006", "2007", 
                                "2008", "2009", "2010","2011", "2012", "2013",
                                "2014", "2015", "2016","2017")
View(Acc_Electricity)

## let's not concentrate on naming
afg <- Acc_Electricity %>% 
            select(c(-Country.Code, -Indicator.Code, -Indicator.Name),-`2017`)
View(afg)

## lets tidy data to plot it for that their is a package called tidyr/tidyverse. 
## I going to use function called gather()

gth <- gather(afg, key = "variable", value= "Value", 2:28)
View(gth)

## Here we are filtering the data to select the nation which I want to compare it can be anything I selected developing countries and war torn country Afghanistan.
af <- gth %>% filter(Country.Name %in% c("Afghanistan", "Angola", "Bangladesh", "India", "China", "Sri Lanka"))
View(af)

```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r access to electricity, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(af, aes(as.numeric(variable), Value, colour=Country.Name)) + 
  geom_line(linetype = 7, size=1) + 
  ggtitle("Access of Electricity through various Years") + labs(x="Year", y="Frequency")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
